## Content Based Recommendation Engines

The project initially uses the information retrieval paper “A content-based goods image recommendation system” as a baseline model to generate similarity scores for images. The same content-based image retrieval technique is now extended to Deep Learning models and architectures to achieve better results and generate most similar recommendations.


## Approach

</p>

I have used pretrained model RESNET-50 to fetch similar products for recommedation.
ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. One can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database
